## Taara

I've always loved animals since I was young, but growing up, we weren't allowed to have any pets. In 2020, covid struck and like many people, me and my family were sitting home bored. My older sister and I capitalized on at this time and convinced my parents to adopt a kitten. Introducing my first-born, Taara: ![IMG-20240222-WA0011](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d9f5664-9f76-4e28-a1f4-932dc0ee7596) We adopted her when she was 8 weeks old from the Beaver county shelter. She was always extremely shy, but with lots of time and love, Taara has become an integral part of my family back in Pittsburgh. 

## Mew Cat Rescue

After I graduated college, I took a big leap and moved 15 hours away from home. From Pittsburgh, I found myself in Northwest Arkanasas; it was a complete change of pace. As somebody who values community, I knew volunteering at a cat rescue would be the perfect fit for me and fill the cat shaped hole in my heart. Currently, I am foster cat mom, cat babysitter and am involved in helping write grants to support the non-profit I volunteer with, Mew Cat Rescues.

## Mishu

Living alone in a new city was proving to be a lot more lonely than I thought. But then I met a fuzzy orange baby girl named Oyster. At first, she was extremely scared hiding under my couch. With some coaxing, she's gotten a lot more friendly and out-going. I knew immediately, Oyster now named Mishu, would be a foster fail. I chose the name Mishu as it means sweet in Bengali and is the best way to describe her sweet, innocent nature. Mishu had a hard life before meeting me. Her previous owners had abandoned her, her husband and her kittens. When found, the whole cat family had upper respiratory infections. I would come home from work and Mishu's eye would be crusted shut. She would be blind and hiding scared of what might be out there. With lots of love and care (and medicine!), she has made a full recovery. Her eyes are now wide open and ready to take on the world! Mishu loves to spend her days sleeping, till I come home and then she and I will cuddle, watch TV and nap together. My second-born, Mishu: ![PXL_20241018_150507806](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/764752a9-e51d-4c33-a8ee-96c2568dc867)
