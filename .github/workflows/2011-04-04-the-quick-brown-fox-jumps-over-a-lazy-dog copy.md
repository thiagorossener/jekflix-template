In this project, I analyzed the draft position value and team success/deficiencies compared to expectation, created a method for valueing each drat slot in the NBA draft, and gained insights to productivity score by team.

From this graph above, the model proves to be fairly strong because the value decreases from pick to pick. I forced the quadractic program to pick numbers that decrease by at least 5% from pick to pick in order to produce a smoother graph.

I also analyzed college teams with players that outperformed expectations in the NBA by grouping the data by college and calculate the average value over replacement.

Lastly, I analyze the data by gaining insights into productivity score by team with the above graph as the result of the findings. 

In this project, I have also analyzed the relationship between a team's first round pick in one year with their first-roun pick slot in the subsequent year and the players in the NBA teams.
